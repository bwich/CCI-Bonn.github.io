I am Manuel Debić, the IT/Infrastructure Lead at the Division for Computational Radiology & Clinical AI (CCI) at the University Hospital in Bonn. My work focuses on managing and developing the technical infrastructure to support research in computational radiology and clinical AI.

Previously, I served as the IT Head at the Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology at Heidelberg University Hospital (UKHD), where I led IT projects, managed technical infrastructure, and supported both clinical and research activities. This role provided me with extensive experience in integrating technology into healthcare environments.

I have a Master’s degree in Medical Informatics from Heidelberg University and a Bachelor’s degree in Medical Engineering from Pforzheim University. My background helps me contribute to research projects and practical applications in healthcare technology.

I’m passionate about using technology to improve healthcare and enjoy working with others to find practical solutions to complex problems.
