I lead the "Oncological Imaging" research group at the Clinic of Neuroradiology, University Hospital Bonn. As a radiologist with an additional degree in Medical Physics, I am passionate about advancing quantitative magnetic resonance imaging in oncology and enhancing workflow efficiency through artificial intelligence and deep learning. I believe in the power of interdisciplinary collaboration and am committed to driving the rapid translation of transformative technologies like deep learning into medical practice, with the ultimate goal of improving patient care and shaping the future of radiology.
